1.The evening of Annual Day 2020 saw students explicitly justifying the theme 'Rediscovering India'. The evening saw an amalgamation of emotions of all sort. We are not just proud of the students who performed so incredibly but also to all those who contributed in the preparation of those performances, right from the script till the execution.

The aura on the evening was filled with pious dedication and justification to the acts and the theme. We are extremely thankful to the parents for being cheerful and motivating to their kids from the beginning till the end of the event.

Here is the show reel of the entire event summed up in a few minute. Thank you to all the Students, Parents, teaching and Non-teaching staff.

Grateful to all for delivering the best show and making the evening memorable.
